- The KY-026 flame sensor is connected to pin 5 of the Arduino.
- The MQ-135 gas sensor is connected to pin A0 of Arduino.
- The KY-035 hall effect sensor is connected to pin 3 of the Arduino.
- The ultrasonic sensor HCSR04 is connected to pins 7 and 8 of the Arduino.
- TMP36GT9Z sensors are connected to pins A2 & A4 for Motor and Motor Battery respectively on Arduino.
- The buzzer is connected to pin 10 of the Arduino.
- Arduino is connected via USB cable for serial communication to the Raspberry pi.
- Raspberry pi is connected to the 10' Touchscreen via HDMI for multimedia and USB for touch and power.
- To be continued!
